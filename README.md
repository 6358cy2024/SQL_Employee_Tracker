# SQL_Employee_Tracker

The purpose of this assignment is to utilize SQL elements and create a database that can store information related to a workplace and allow user input.

From what we have learned in class at this point we will create three sql files that will create tables, put in values in the tables and then query to SELECT * FROM.

This will allow users to register new employees, add roles, departments, all three tables and then update the information of any employee.

Once the user runs the program in the terminal they will answer a question on what they would like to do. Then the MenuSystem file will carry out whatever function they selected.
